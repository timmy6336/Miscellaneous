Our project, Kanto Spirit,  was developed on the Google Cloud Platform using a L.A.M.P 
virtual machine with a custom SQL database written in BCNF format.The .sql database 
contents were uploaded to a PHPMyAdmin instance on the GCP VM. We wrote all code 
in the ICECoder remote text editor that we installed ourselves.
